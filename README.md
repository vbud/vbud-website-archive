My website.


## highlight.js choices

I downloaded a custom package of highlight.js for use with this site. I selected the following languages on the [highlightjs download page](https://highlightjs.org/download/):
- Bash
- CSS
- HTTP
- JavaScript
- JSON
- Markdown
- SCSS

The js and css from the downloaded package are located in `src/_dependencies`.
