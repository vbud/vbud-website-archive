# About me

Hi, I'm Valjean Clark III. I am an interaction designer and developer currently working for Intel. Check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valjeanbud) if you are interested in specific skills or background.

I have a Masters in Human-Computer Interaction and a Bachelors in Computer Science. Along with some minors in mathematics and games.

And yes, I was named after Jean Valjean from [Les Miserables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables). Feel free to ask me about it sometime :).
