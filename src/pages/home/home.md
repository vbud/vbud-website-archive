# About me

Hi, I'm Valjean Clark III. I am an interaction designer and developer currently working for Intel. Check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valjeanbud) if you are interested in specific skills or background.

I have a Masters in Human-Computer Interaction and a Bachelors in Computer Science. Along with some minors in mathematics and games.

And yes, I was named after Jean Valjean from [Les Miserables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables). Feel free to ask me about it sometime :).

You can get in touch with me at valjeanbud [at] gmail.com or [@valjeanbud](https://twitter.com/valjeanbud) on Twitter.



# Current side projects

[starter-angular-babel](https://github.com/vbud/starter-angular-babel) is my starter project for ES6, Angular-based web applications. I also use a modified version of it at work.

ewb is a browser-based e-whiteboard that multiple people can use simultaneously. I have a not-so-polished version working but I don't have it hosted anywhere yet. You can check out the [client](https://github.com/vbud/ewb-client) and [server](https://github.com/vbud/ewb-server) code on Github.



# Things I did in school

Here are a few cool things I made during my Masters and Bachelors degrees.

[Master's Thesis: Exploring design and product development data using data visualization](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8576989/Thesis_ValjeanClark_final.pdf): I worked with both Uppsala Universitet and Intel to research and design a solution to the difficult process of creating, storing, and sharing product development data. Several prototypes were built, three of which were attached to sample company data and tested with users. Publicly viewable links to the visualizations are pending (as of August 2013). Please send me an email if you are interested in seeing more about this work.

[Gripen Display Proposal](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bqmwS_Woh9g98cSVAKKNmPgPx5DSCaYuBHHtZjMFBhU/edit?usp=sharing): This was fun - I was able to see the hardware and interfaces in use in the cockpit of a SAAB Gripen fighter jet and provide design recommendations for my Perception Theory course during my masters courses. We recommended improvements to their 2D interface, as well as some things they could try in 3D (with a big disclaimer that 3D interfaces are especially difficult). I also flew the flight simulator.

[ReVis3d](http://youtu.be/S-Y4zOWojNw?t=3m6s): Resource Visualization in 3D: ReVis3D was the result of my undergraduate senior project course. I learned a lot about graphics programming and the difficulties and limitations of showing data in three dimensions.
