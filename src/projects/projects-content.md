# Portfolio

[Check out my portfolio](http://vbud.github.io/portfolio)!

I work on internal applications and tools at Intel, so I cannot share source code or working applications, but the portfolio contains screenshots and descriptions.

Also, you can [check out my resume](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8576989/Resume%20-%20Valjean%20Clark%20III.pdf).


# Current side projects

[starter-angular-babel][starter-angular-babel] is my starter project for ES6, Angular-based web applications. I also use a modified version of it at work.

[This website](https://github.com/vbud/vbud.github.io) has turned into a side project of its own. It has morphed into a static site generator using a combination of gulp and Angular. I used [starter-angular-babel][starter-angular-babel] to stub it out, then added some markdown rendering on the front-end with [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked), then essentially added a [blog generator gulp task](https://github.com/vbud/vbud.github.io/blob/working/gulp/blog.js). The end result is that I author the whole site in markdown, and any new blog posts are picked up automatically by the build system. Epic scope creep, but worth it :). 

ewb is a browser-based e-whiteboard that multiple people can use simultaneously. I have a not-so-polished version working but I don't have it hosted anywhere yet. You can check out the [client](https://github.com/vbud/ewb-client) and [server](https://github.com/vbud/ewb-server) code on Github.


# Things I did in school

Here are a few cool things I made during my Masters and Bachelors degrees.

[Master's Thesis: Exploring design and product development data using data visualization](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8576989/Thesis_ValjeanClark_final.pdf): I worked with both Uppsala Universitet and Intel to research and design a solution to the difficult process of creating, storing, and sharing product development data. Several prototypes were built, three of which were attached to company data and tested with users.

[Gripen Display Proposal](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bqmwS_Woh9g98cSVAKKNmPgPx5DSCaYuBHHtZjMFBhU/edit?usp=sharing): This was fun - I was able to evaluate the hardware and interfaces in use in the cockpit of a SAAB Gripen fighter jet for the Perception Theory course of my Masters. We recommended design improvements to their 2D interface, as well as some things they could try in 3D and 2.5D (with a big disclaimer that 3D interfaces are especially difficult to implement effectively). I also flew the flight simulator.

[ReVis3d](http://youtu.be/S-Y4zOWojNw?t=3m6s): Resource Visualization in 3D: ReVis3D was the result of my undergraduate senior project course. I learned a lot about graphics programming and the difficulties and limitations of showing data in three dimensions.
